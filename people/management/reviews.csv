"Notes: ","Kelly Clarke's manager failed to do her review on 1/1/18 and on 1/1/19.  He said that he would have given her a 1-step increase on 1/1/18 from EA Range 25 Step 6 to EA Range 25 Step 7, and then a 1-step increase on 1/1/19 from EA Range 25 Step 7 to EA Range 25 Step 8.  So, I am putting her in for this pay period (as of 6/2/19) as a 2-step increase, and I am asking Payroll to process retroactive pay for her for the period of 1/1/18 to 12/31/18 (which includes a COLA at 7/1/18) at Step 6 and for the period 1/1/19 to 6/1/19 at Step 7.
